General Rules:
    1. Avoid Class in Class (except for util)
    2. Write final MCL in main instead of class
    3. Seperate program into Particles, SensorModel, MotionModel 
        (Resampling and Updating weight outside class)

Naming Convention:
    variable: use _
        e.g. this_is_a_variable

    Class: Camel with capital letter
        e.g. SensorModel

    Functionality: Camel with capital letter
        e.g. PredictMotion(...)

    get & set: Camel with lower letter
        e.g. getWeight(...)
